                To live consciously. To commit to the way of the mind. To embrace the way of the universe. To create the self. To erase the unconscious compulsive character code. To delve into the depths of the features. To let time off only in the companionship of the muse of creation and exploration.

                You must leave now, take what you need you think will last
                But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
                yonder stands your orphan with his gun
                crying like a fire in the sun
                look out the saints are coming through
                and its all over now baby blue
                the highway is for gamblers better use your sense
                take what you have gathered from coincidence
                the empty handed painter from your streets
                is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
                the sky too is fallin over you
                and its all over now baby blue
                all your seasick sailors they re all rowing home
                all your empty handed armies they re all going home
                the lover who just walked out the door
                has taken all his blankets from the floor
                the carpet too is moving under you
                and its all over now baby blue
                leave your stepping stones behind 
                theres something that calls for you
                forget the dead you ve left they will not follow you
                the vagabond whos rapping at your door
                is standing in the clothes that you once wore
                strike another match go start anew
                and its all over now baby blue
            </pre></p>
