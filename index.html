                To live consciously. To commit to the way of the mind. To embrace the way of the universe. To create the self. To erase the unconscious compulsive character code. To delve into the depths of the features. To let time off only in the companionship of the muse of creation and exploration.

                Don't write what is obvious. Decided to start writing in order to have clarity in my thoughts and figure them. Will try to write as much as possible. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So I will leave this website as it is for now. Will keep that search bar atop and just append to the document end when I want to add a new entry. This won't really be a journal or a diary, or at least I wish to not. 
            </p>

                What is hacking? What is discipline? Why do you actions not follow your thoughts? A misalignment of the action and your current action circuitry? Then how to intervene this circuitry? I feel focused right now, as I am writing. Is it because I have wrote often to a considerable amount throughout my years and the action circuitry for that is relatively developed compared to what I am trying to do? Ok so I am going to think of a large action circuitry within a brain, which branches to individual, more specific action circuitry.

                Fell asleep yesterday so the entry remained incomplete. And the thought train was broken anyway. It's morning right now so obviously not the time to be writing. So will be going now and will see if I come back to this in the evening.
